The application is C\# object-\/oritented implementation of the epidemic simulation employing make building system. Win\+Forms and XNA (FNA) frameworks were used to created graphical user interface. The user can set up different initial parameters of simulation including disease lethality, communicability, duration and simulated population. There are three different scenarios enriching the user experience\+: 1) single community simulation, 2) shopping community simulation and 3) multigroup community simulation. The user is able to observe the spread of the germ in real time as well as follow graphs depicting progress of the disease. At the very end of simulation, the file containg detalied statistics is being generated. The project has been created and developed as university project for the \textquotesingle{}Object-\/\+Oriented Programming\textquotesingle{} course. It contains unit tests and automatically generated documentation thanks to doxygen.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Available commands}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
